Getter : A getter is a method that is used to retrieve the value of a property. 
It allows you to define the process of accessing the value of a property. 
You define a getter using the get keyword followed by the property name.

Setter : A setter is a method that is used to set the value of a property. 
It allows you to define the process of assigning a value to a property. 
You define a setter using the set keyword followed by the property name.
